Hello World - First repository - INFM109
# About Me
Hi, glad to have you visit my first repository!  I'm **Josh Barkley**, a married 37 year old male from Greenwood, IN.  I have 2 children.  My son i 13 and my daughter is 5.  I was honored to serve 8 years in the *US Marine Corps* before getting into sales and business.  I enjoy playing disc golf in my free time along with being outdoors with my family.  We love to travel when we get a chance and I am the person that could enjoy Disney World with just my wife and I.  I am excited to get started with this class and learn how to take my passion of making business more efficient and tie that to acquired skills I will develop over time.  My 3 main goals are:
* Working with businesses to streamline their sales production
* Create automation within businesses for communication of all things
* Automate reports from queried data to create relevant changes within a company
